# Phishing-Detection-System-Through-Hybrid-Machine-Learning-Model-Based-URL
This project detects phishing websites by analyzing URL features using a hybrid machine learning model. It combines Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree through voting to improve accuracy. The system identifies suspicious patterns in URLs and classifies them as legitimate or phishing, helping users stay safe from online attacks.

This project shows how machine learning can be used to detect phishing websites, which are fake sites designed to steal personal information. We used algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, and LightGBM to classify a website as either safe or phishing.

To do this, we collected a dataset of websites and used features such as domain details, URL length, special characters, HTTPS usage, and redirection patterns. With the help of Count Vectorizer, we converted these website details into a format that machine learning models can understand.

We trained and tested our models, and the results showed good accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, proving that our system works reliably.

The main advantage of this project is that it provides an automatic and scalable way to protect users and organizations from phishing attacks, helping prevent identity theft, financial loss, and malware spread.

In short, this project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems in cybersecurity and offers an effective solution to improve online safety.
